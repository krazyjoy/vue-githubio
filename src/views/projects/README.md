## Concepts
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model,
so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data before generating
a response.

- Major Task : Generative AI chatbot responding
- Challenges of LLMs : 
    - Presenting false information 
    - Presenting out-of-date or generic information
    - Creating a response from non-authoritative sources
    
- Benefits of RAG :
    - cost-effective implementation
    - current information
    - enhanced user trust
    - more developer control

- Process of RAG
    - Retrieve
    - Augment 
    - Generate
